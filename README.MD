# Horiseon Site Refactored for Accessibility

## Description

This project is to refactor the HTML and CSS code on the Horiseon site to make it more accessible. I made this to practice refactoring existing code. Previously, there were many flaws making the HTML and CSS files difficult to navigate. In the process, I learned about DOM flow and what kind of tag usage can make a website more efficient and accessible.
